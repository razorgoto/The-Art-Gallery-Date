The Art Gallery Date

They were heading back up north on the southbound train. Boarding at Museum Station. The two of them – on the knee-knocking side of the subway cart – swaying left and right with each braking and speeding up of the train.

This was now the end of their evening.

It had been a strange sort of an art gallery date. The sort that a man normally would engineer on a second date for a woman he likes -- if the first had gone really well.

This really didn’t apply for this evening to the two of them.

Two years now. On and off, they have been seeing each other. Before that they had been friends for four. Jennifer and Matt. All their friends and family had whispered about it like the most natural of things. It was going to happen. It will happen. The two of them just seems so right together.

And when it seemed like they had finally got together, they never made it official, never made an announcement. But they just saw so much of each other ­– always together – everybody just assumed and neither Matt nor Jennifer made denials. And, now, two years in, they are in that plodding sort of way for every other couple trying to make it work and still not wishing to rush it too much.

But they did an art gallery date.

He suggested it knowing fully that she would say yes. It was the extension of their current state of existence together. Every weekend — movie and dinner, or cook at his house, or hang out at --- wherever.

In the omnipresent florescent light of the subway train, they kept their heads forward. Their hands touched neither with force nor lightness – a continual, accidental brush that never leaves contact.

This evening. They both knew that this evening had been different.

It started when he suggested the Klimt exhibit to her over SMS. He wanted to go, he said. She knew that Matt’s idea of art was Joy Division’s album cover. She texted back, “Wat timd?” And it all went from there.

And Matt had thought about it. He remembered on Jennifer’s dorm room wall, in first year, the giant poster of The Kiss. Her roommate, Suki, hated it and had put an equal-sized poster of The Princess’ Bride in mock protest. Jennifer hardly even noticed. So enamored was she by the glossy print. The red lips. The varying, interlaced gold shades. She often knelt before the poster on her bed and closed her eyes the picture’s reclining woman.

A lot of back and forth and they arranged to meet at the ROM. Jennifer lived at Yonge and Eglington and was further a-ways in the north. Matt lived with his younger sister in an apartment on Wellsley and Church. In all their times together he had never offered to “pick her up at her place” nor “walk her back” at the end of the evening.

When Thursday came for their meeting, beneath the giant lunacy of the jagged steel and glass, he had waited for her. He had left the lab early and chanced on the last beam of light that fractured against the blue glass burning Bloor Street orange. She arrived in that shuffling gait of hers like she was wearing perpetual flip-flops. Their eyes met meters away. Brief smiles. They walked pass the doors without exchanging a word.

They found out that The Kiss did not come to Toronto. But so much other things did. Things they had not seen before nor knew about, but were glad to see. Matt had walked away from Jennifer to stare at the painting. He was shocked to see the uncontrolled, dreamy abandonment of The Danae. Glimt, the Master, his redheaded mode, completely devoted to her act of self-love — the rest of the world seems not to be there for artist or subject.

He turned and was thrown in shock when he discovered that Jennifer was standing beside him. She looked over at his eyes – wide-open – and gave a quizzical smile. They turned back to The Danae.

Doubtless they never heard about Glimt’s peccadillo. They were just here for paintings, the colors, and maybe swim the trendiness of a little Art Nouveau.

There wasn’t much else they wanted to see. They left the gallery early and took a walk through the small greens behind Queen’s Park. They held hands with their fingers in a loose knot. She led him between the small trees that were dwarfed by the giant red brick building. Matt’s finger tips twitched. Jennifer felt the ripple and said that it was late. They boarded the subway again at Queen’s Park Station and took the train south.

“I’ll see you off at Wellselly,” she said, “I don’t want to switch trains at St. George to come back to Yonge again. We can go south to round the loop at Union. It’ll be faster. Only one train.”

It is never faster. Any subway driver can tell you so.

He just followed her, as he always does. He would have followed her anywhere if she had asked.

For a long time, they sat staring straight ahead to the inside wall of the subway car. A 17” by 11” glossy poster for a new Sony Ericsson cellphone with the tagline “3.2 Mega-Pixel of Joy!” Matt focused his eyes on the large rectangle of red and lost track of everything.

Time pressed away. The random vibration of the ride, the intensity of heat and pressure of her body against his, were the only mentions of each moment in his awareness.

A loud voice. He woke “College Station. College Station, next,” the driver announced.

The train sped up and there was silence. The light of the next station was visible over the end of the tunnel. The driver slammed the breaks. The full weight of her body spilled into him and he filled his arms completely of her.

He turned his head over to tell her – anything. Thanks for the evening. Or some poor joke about the TTC. Or just to evince a casual smile. But before he could, she tilted her head up over to him. He froze. His mouth parted, dry and dripping silence. She bit her lower lip and a small bit of her tongue touched her front incisors. Matt saw the pink tip for a-tenth of a second and leaned back slightly.

Jennifer saw and she reached forward. Her left hand crossed over the core of her body, over his body, and took his right hand. She placed his hand on his lap and patted it once gently before returning her hand and the whole of herself back to her seat.

“I am getting off here to the Dominions to buy a little grocery,” she said.
“I’ll come with ...”
“No, go home. You have work tomorrow.”

She kissed him just above the line of his beard.

“Good night, I had a good time,” she said as she stepped into the platforms yellow lights.

The train moved again. Matt hummed slowly to himself of a song he had just written yesterday.
